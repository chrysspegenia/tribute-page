        <p id="tribute-info">Anthony Edward "Tony" Stark was a billionaire industrialist, a founding member of the Avengers, and the former CEO of Stark Industries. A 
            brash but brilliant inventor, Stark was self-described as a genius, billionaire, playboy, and philanthropist. With his great wealth and 
            exceptional technical knowledge, Stark was one of the world's most powerful men following the deaths of his parents and enjoyed the playboy 
            lifestyle for many years until he was kidnapped by the Ten Rings in Afghanistan, while demonstrating a fleet of Jericho missiles. With his 
            life on the line, Stark created an armored suit which he used to escape his captors. Upon returning home, he utilized several more armors to 
            use against terrorists, as well as Obadiah Stane who turned against Stark. Following his fight against Stane, Stark publicly revealed himself 
            as Iron Man.

                Suiting up the Iron Armor: The armor used to require several machines to put on the suit, in a lengthy process. Later, this was changed 
                to having it in a suitcase, which shortened the suiting up time, but was not very effective on the battlefield. However, recently, it has 
                been shown that Stark can hold the armor within himself, and use it when needed, and spring into action in mere seconds.

                <li><strong>Superhuman Strength</strong>: He was capable of lifting up to over 100 tons when he wore his armor.</li>
                <li><strong>Superhuman Speed</strong>: Even when not traveling for extended distances, the armor enabled the wearer to move and react at high speeds.</li>
                <li><strong>Flight</strong>: The armor could typically reach speeds in excess of Mach 8, however, later Iron Man armor was able to reach orbital velocities 
                    (5 miles per second) and up to speeds that could outrun black holes. Use of the jet boots provided enough power to lift a load of about 500 tons.</li>

            Tony Stark was an intelligent, arrogant, outspoken and outgoing man who possessed a strong wit. He enjoyed drinking, partying and gambling 
            and this reckless and addictive behavior helped lead to his continuous struggle with alcoholism. Many considered him to be both egotistical 
            and selfish and even Stark himself agreed that he was narcissistic. He also liked being in control of his own life and he occasionally 
            displayed traits of germophobia.
